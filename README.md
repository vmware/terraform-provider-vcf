## Using the Provider

The Terraform Provider for VMware Cloud Foundation is a Partner tier provider.

Partner tier providers are owned and maintained by a partner in the HashiCorp Technology Partner Program. HashiCorp verifies the authenticity of the publisher and the provider is listed on the [Terraform Registry][terraform-registry] with a Partner tier label.

To use a released version of the Terraform provider in your environment, run `terraform init` and Terraform will automatically install the provider from the Terraform Registry.

Unless you are contributing to the provider or require a pre-release bugfix or feature, use a
released version of the provider.

See [Installing the Terraform Provider for VMware Cloud Foundation][provider-install] for additional instructions on automated and manual installation methods and how to control the provider version.

For either installation method, documentation about the provider configuration, resources, and data sources can be found on the Terraform Registry.

## Upgrading the Provider

The provider does not upgrade automatically. After each new release, you can run the following command to upgrade the provider:

```shell
terraform init -upgrade
```
