## [v0.4.0](https://github.com/vmware/terraform-provider-vcf/releases/tag/v0.4.0)

> Release Date: Sep 11th 2023

BREAKING CHANGES:

* Removed the attribute "host_id" from the "vcf_host" resource and replaced it with just "id" as per Terraform standard practice. This way users can refer to the Host UUID (in cluster host spec for example) in the standard way, e.g. "vcf_host.host1.id".
* Replaced attribute "nsx_cluster_ref" from the "vcf_domain" data source with a richer "nsx_configuration", that additionally contains IPs, Names and DNS Names of NSX-T Manager Nodes.
* Renamed attribute "nsx_configuration.nsx_manager_node.dns_name" in "vcf_domain" to "nsx_configuration.nsx_manager_node.fqdn" for clarity.
* Renamed attribute "vcenter" to "vcenter_configuration" in "vcf_domain" resource and "vcf_domain" data source.
* Replaced attribute "dns_name" in "vcenter_configuration" in "vcf_domain" resource with "fqdn".
* Replaced attribute "vcenter_fqdn" and "vcenter_id from the "vcf_domain" data source with "vcenter_configuration" subresource, that contains "id" and "fqdn" attributes.

FEATURES:

* Extend support for host resource: import. [\#36](https://github.com/vmware/terraform-provider-vcf/issues/36)
* Add support for workload domain resource: import. [\#35](https://github.com/vmware/terraform-provider-vcf/issues/35)
* Add support for configuration of NSX host TEP pool (static / DHCP) in `r/vcf_domain`. [\#54](https://github.com/vmware/terraform-provider-vcf/issues/54)

**Note:** Management domain cannot be imported, but can be used as data source.

BUG FIXES:

* Include "domain_id" attribute to both imported cluster and cluster data source. [\#49](https://github.com/vmware/terraform-provider-vcf/issues/49)
