# vcf_external_certificate (Resource)

Replaces a Certificate of a Domain resource (VCENTER, SDDC_MANAGER) with a Certificate, generated by an external CA.

Prerequisites for installing a certificate:
* The SDDC Manager should be up and running.
* The resources of the target domain (e.g. MGMT) should be in ACTIVE state.
* CSR generated for the target resource.

Warnings:
* Certificate installation will replace the already installed certificates.

Notes:
* The CSRs cannot be fetched after successful certificate installation.
* Only the latest generated CSRs will exist in the VCF environment after a series of generate CSR operation.
* Only the latest generated certificates will exist in the VCF environment after a series of generate certificate operation.
