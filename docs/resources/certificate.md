# vcf_certificate (Resource)

Replaces a Certificate of a Domain resource (VCENTER, SDDC_MANAGER) with a Certificate, generated by a configured
internal CA.

Prerequisites for installing a certificate:
* The SDDC Manager should be up and running.
* The resources of the target domain (e.g. MGMT) should be in ACTIVE state.
* Configured Certificate Authority.
* CSR generated for the target resource.


Warnings:
* Certificate installation will replace the already installed certificates.

Notes:
* The CSRs cannot be fetched after successful certificate installation.
* Only singleton object of a particular certificate authority will exist at any point of time in the VCF environment.
* Only the latest generated CSRs will exist in the VCF environment after a series of generate CSR operation.
* Only the latest generated certificates will exist in the VCF environment after a series of generate certificate operation.
